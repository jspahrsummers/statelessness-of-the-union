    - Who am I?
    - About this event
- What is ReactiveCocoa?
    - Not just KVO
    - Not just data binding
    - Not just futures
- Problems with ReactiveCocoa 2
    - “WTF is in this signal?”
    - “Hot” and “cold” signals
        - Subjects
        - Multicasting
        - Replaying
    - `RACCommand`
    - `-flattenMap:` preference vs. `-concat` and `-switchToLatest`
    - “Too much magic”
    - Unexpected errors (e.g., in property binding)
- A wild Swift appears
    - Parameterized types
    - Value types
    - No macros
    - Less dynamic programming (KVC, KVO, `-rac_signalForSelector:`)
- How ReactiveCocoa 3 solves these problems (a.k.a. a walk through the changelog)
    - Parameterized values
    - Parameterized errors and `NoError`
    - `Signal` and `SignalProducer` split
        - `Signal.pipe` instead of subjects
        - `SignalProducer.buffer` instead of replaying
        - `startWithSignal` instead of multicasting
    - `Action` instead of commands
    - `flatMap`, `flatten` strategy
    - `PropertyType`
- Simple vs. easy
    - There's probably nothing I've referenced more in the past year
    - RAC 2 is neither easy nor simple
    - Hopefully, RAC 3 is simple (although it's still not always easy)
- Remaining work before 3.0
    - Long-form documentation
- Contributors
    - Recognizing significant contributions to RAC 3
    - Interested in contributing?
